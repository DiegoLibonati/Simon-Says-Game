# Simon Says Game

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Execute: `npm install`
4. Execute: `npm run dev`

The application will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

## Description

I made a website that allows you to play simon says. You can choose between 3 difficulties: easy, medium and hard. The difference between these difficulties is the speed that the colors will be shown on the screen. Being easy very slow and hard very fast the game itself. Each time we do well the pattern of colors indicated by the game we will add 1 point.

## Technologies used

1. Typescript
2. CSS3
3. HTML5
4. Vite
